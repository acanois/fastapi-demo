# FastAPI Demo

## Overview
This is an example app meant to showcase how I would set up a basic REST API. 

### Why Python?
The main reason is I know it well and I like it. I think it's dead simple to read and write. It's widely known, and good for illustrating concepts. For back-end work, I prefer it to Node, though Node has a lot of great features as well. Go is also very nice. It's compiled and you can pass by reference, making it low-footprint and fast.

### Why FastAPI?
I chose FastAPI because it's quick to set up and comes with a lot of essential features out of the box: Oauth2, database connectivity, data validation, and testing. It also generates Swagger docs on the fly, with no setup.
